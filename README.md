# Interactive Histopathological Image Segmentation
# Table of Contents
# Introduction
Digital pathology enables the acquisition, management and sharing of information retrieved from stained digitised tissue sections from patient-derived biopsies in a digital environment. This offers many benefits including image interpretation by remotely located specialists or further use of the samples for scientific purposes.
Histopathological image classification plays a vital role in the field of medicine and biomedical research, offering invaluable insights into various diseases and conditions. Some key points highlighting its significance include:

Early Disease Detection: Histopathological images provide detailed information about tissue structures and cellular abnormalities, enabling early detection of diseases such as cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Accurate classification of these images can lead to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

Precision Medicine: With advancements in technology, histopathological image classifiers can assist healthcare professionals in tailoring treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics. This approach, known as precision medicine, ensures personalized and effective treatments, minimizing adverse effects and optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

Research Advancements: Histopathological image classification serves as a cornerstone for biomedical research, facilitating the discovery of disease biomarkers, elucidation of disease mechanisms, and development of novel therapeutic interventions. By analyzing large datasets of histopathological images, researchers can uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that contribute to advancements in medical science.
